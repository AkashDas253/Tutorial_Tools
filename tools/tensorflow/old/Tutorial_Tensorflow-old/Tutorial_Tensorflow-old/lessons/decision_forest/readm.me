## **TensorFlow Decision Forests (TF-DF)**

**TensorFlow Decision Forests (TF-DF)** is a library built by Google that integrates decision forests (such as **Random Forests** and **Gradient Boosted Trees**) into the TensorFlow ecosystem. It allows users to leverage decision trees for both classification and regression tasks, and is particularly useful for tasks where traditional deep learning models might not be the best choice, like structured/tabular data.

TF-DF is designed to be highly scalable and is compatible with TensorFlow, making it easy to train decision forests alongside other TensorFlow models. It is especially helpful when working with decision tree-based models, which are often interpretable and perform well on a variety of tasks.

   - TensorFlow Decision Forests is designed to be a seamless addition to the TensorFlow ecosystem, allowing you to use models like decision trees alongside neural networks.
   
2. **Tree-based Models**:
   - Includes **Random Forests** and **Gradient Boosted Trees (GBTs)** for both classification and regression tasks.
   
3. **Model Interpretability**:
   - Tree-based models are more interpretable than many other machine learning models, making it easier to understand how the model arrives at predictions.

4. **Scalability**:
   - TF-DF is optimized for training on large datasets, and it leverages the parallel processing power of modern CPUs and GPUs for scalability.
   
5. **Support for TensorFlow and Keras**:
   - Models from TF-DF can be used with TensorFlow's high-level **Keras API** for training and evaluation.
   
6. **Multiclass and Multilabel Classification**:
   - TF-DF supports both binary and multiclass classification tasks, as well as multilabel classification where each sample may belong to multiple classes.

| **`RandomForestModel`** | A model based on the Random Forest algorithm. It builds multiple decision trees in parallel and combines their predictions.                                               |
| **`GradientBoostedTreesModel`** | A model based on the Gradient Boosted Trees algorithm, which sequentially builds trees that correct the errors made by previous trees in the sequence.                   |

### **Supported Models in TensorFlow Decision Forests**

1. **Random Forest Classifier/Regressor**:
   - A **Random Forest** is an ensemble method that creates multiple decision trees and combines their results to improve performance.
   
2. **Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT)**:
   - **Gradient Boosted Trees** are built sequentially, with each new tree attempting to correct the errors made by the previous trees.

### **Basic Workflow in TensorFlow Decision Forests**

#### **1. Import Required Libraries**

```python
import tensorflow_decision_forests as tfdf
import tensorflow as tf
```

#### **2. Load and Prepare the Data**

TF-DF works with `pandas` DataFrames or `tf.data.Dataset` to handle the dataset. Here's how you can load a dataset and prepare it.

```python
# Load dataset using Pandas
import pandas as pd

# Example dataset (e.g., a classification task)
df = pd.read_csv("your_dataset.csv")

# Split dataset into features and labels
features = df.drop("target", axis=1)
labels = df["target"]

# Convert DataFrame to TensorFlow Dataset
dataset = tfdf.keras.pd_dataframe_to_tf_dataset(df, task=tfdf.keras.Task.CLASSIFICATION)
```

#### **3. Train a Random Forest Model**

```python
# Train a Random Forest model
model = tfdf.keras.RandomForestModel(task=tfdf.keras.Task.CLASSIFICATION)
model.fit(dataset)
```

#### **4. Evaluate the Model**

After training, you can evaluate the model on a test set or using cross-validation:

```python
# Evaluate model on test dataset
test_df = pd.read_csv("your_test_data.csv")
test_dataset = tfdf.keras.pd_dataframe_to_tf_dataset(test_df, task=tfdf.keras.Task.CLASSIFICATION)

# Evaluate the trained model
model.evaluate(test_dataset)
```

#### **5. Make Predictions**

You can also use the trained model to make predictions on new data:

```python
# Making predictions on new data
predictions = model.predict(test_dataset)

for prediction in predictions:
    print(prediction)
```

---

### **Model Interpretation**

- **Feature Importance**: Decision trees, including Random Forests and Gradient Boosted Trees, provide interpretable models, and you can inspect feature importance to understand which features are contributing the most to the model's predictions.
  
```python
# Get feature importances
importances = model.make_inspector().feature_importances()

# Print feature importance
for feature, importance in zip(df.columns, importances):
    print(f"{feature}: {importance}")
```

- **Model Visualization**: You can visualize decision trees in TF-DF. It provides a way to extract and visualize individual trees within a random forest or gradient boosted tree model.

```python
# Inspect and print out decision trees
inspector = model.make_inspector()

# Print out one of the trees
tree = inspector.extract_decision_tree(0)
print(tree)
```
