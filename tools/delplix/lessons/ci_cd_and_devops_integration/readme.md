## **CI/CD and DevOps Integration** in Delphix

---

### **Objective**

Integrate Delphix into **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** and **DevOps pipelines** to enable **automated, secure, and production-like test data** provisioning, refresh, and cleanup — without manual intervention.

### **Key Capabilities**

| Capability                      | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **REST APIs & CLI**             | Automate all Delphix operations (provision, refresh, masking, cleanup).     |
| **JetStream Integration**       | Enables versioning, branching, and data lifecycle control in pipelines.     |
| **Data Provisioning on Demand** | Automatically create fresh environments before build/test steps.            |
| **Data Refresh**                | Update test data from production snapshots regularly or per pipeline run.   |
| **Branching & Rewind**          | Parallel test branches with rollback to consistent snapshots.               |
| **Environment Teardown**        | Automate cleanup post-testing to free up resources.                         |
| **Secure Data Delivery**        | Masked data integrated directly into CI/CD without exposing sensitive info. |
| **Event-Driven Automation**     | Trigger data operations based on events (e.g., pull requests, commits).     |

### **Typical Workflow in DevOps Pipelines**

```text
1. Commit Code (Dev)
   ↓
2. CI/CD Tool (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab) triggers:
   - Test data provisioning via Delphix API
   - Environment setup
   ↓
3. Run Tests (unit, integration, regression)
   ↓
4. Optionally refresh/rewind data or parallel branch
   ↓
5. Tear down environment or archive data state
```

### **Common Integrations**

| Tool/Platform           | Integration Type                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Jenkins**             | Pipeline steps using REST API or CLI                 |
| **GitLab CI/CD**        | Provision, mask, refresh as part of `.gitlab-ci.yml` |
| **Azure DevOps**        | Custom tasks using Delphix CLI or API                |
| **Terraform / Ansible** | Infrastructure and data provisioning in sync         |
| **Kubernetes**          | Support for data provisioning in containerized CI/CD |
| **ServiceNow**          | Change/request-based test data delivery automation   |

### **Use Cases**

* Automated provisioning of test environments during CI/CD runs
* Parallel branch testing with snapshot isolation
* On-demand rollback to known data states
* Regression test consistency across builds
* Compliance-ready test data for all pipelines
* Simulated production-like testing in ephemeral containers/VMs

### **Benefits**

| Area           | Benefit                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speed**      | Environments provisioned in minutes during pipeline execution |
| **Quality**    | Realistic, consistent test data ensures reliable test results |
| **Security**   | Masked data protects privacy across all DevOps stages         |
| **Agility**    | Enables faster, iterative releases with high test fidelity    |
| **Efficiency** | Reduces manual overhead in test data setup/cleanup            |

---

### **Best Practices**

* Use **bookmarks** and **branches** to isolate data versions per test suite
* Include **data masking jobs** in pre-deployment hooks
* Schedule regular **data refresh pipelines** synced with production
* Use **naming conventions** for automated vDBs/vFiles in pipelines
* Employ **parallel pipelines** with Delphix branching for scalable testing

---

### **Challenges Solved**

* Eliminates delays due to unavailable or inconsistent test data
* Replaces fragile scripts with scalable automation
* Supports compliance in automated test flows
* Reduces rework due to data/environment mismatches
