## Delphix Use Cases

---

### **Dev/Test Environment Provisioning**

* Rapid provisioning of production-like environments.
* Virtual databases/files enable fast cloning.
* Supports parallel testing, CI/CD pipelines, and sandbox environments.
* Reduces wait times and storage overhead.

---

### **Test Data Management (TDM)**

* Combines virtualization and masking for complete TDM.
* Delivers consistent, compliant test data on demand.
* Enables data versioning, rollback, bookmarking, and refresh.

---

### **Data Masking for Compliance**

* Ensures data privacy in non-production environments.
* Supports compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, CCPA, etc.
* Automates masking workflows across multiple data sources.
* Protects sensitive data during development, testing, and training.

---

### **CI/CD and DevOps Integration**

* Provides fresh, consistent data for automated testing.
* Integrates with CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab, Azure DevOps).
* Automates data provisioning and refresh in pipelines.
* Supports test environment cleanup and rollback.

---

### **Cloud Migration and Hybrid Cloud Enablement**

* Enables secure, efficient migration of data to cloud targets.
* Creates virtual datasets in cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI).
* Supports hybrid architectures with consistent data delivery across cloud and on-premise.

---

### **Data Analytics and Machine Learning**

* Delivers production-like datasets to data science teams.
* Enables experimentation with masked data.
* Supports data versioning and branching for model testing.
* Reduces risk of exposing sensitive production data.

---

### **Disaster Recovery Testing**

* Provides on-demand access to point-in-time snapshots.
* Enables testing of recovery procedures without affecting production.
* Supports rollback to known-good states quickly and repeatedly.

---

### **Training and Demo Environments**

* Provision realistic datasets for internal or customer training.
* Quickly reset environments after each session.
* Mask confidential data to ensure privacy.

---

### **Upgrade and Patch Testing**

* Create cloned environments for upgrade validation.
* Enables testing of patches and system updates in isolated setups.
* Helps reduce production downtime by validating changes in advance.

---

### **Data Archival and Retention Testing**

* Allows validation of retention policies using old snapshots.
* Provides time-travel capabilities to reproduce historical data states.

---

### **Performance Testing and Benchmarking**

* Provision multiple copies of the same dataset for concurrent load testing.
* Helps simulate production loads in isolated test environments.
