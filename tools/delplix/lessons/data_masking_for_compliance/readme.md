## **Data Masking for Compliance** in Delphix

---

### **Objective**

Protect sensitive data in non-production environments (dev, test, analytics) by applying **irreversible masking** to meet **data privacy and regulatory compliance** requirements.

### **Core Functions**

| Function                              | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sensitive Data Discovery**          | Scans schemas to locate Personally Identifiable Information (PII), PHI, PCI, etc. |
| **Masking Rules Engine**              | Applies built-in or custom rules to anonymize sensitive data                      |
| **Format-Preserving Masking**         | Maintains original format (length, type, checksum) of data fields                 |
| **Deterministic Masking**             | Ensures same input always produces same masked output (for joins)                 |
| **Reversible Masking**                | Not supported â€“ ensures data cannot be restored                                   |
| **Multi-Source Masking**              | Supports masking across databases, files, and applications                        |
| **Consistent Masking Across Systems** | Preserves referential integrity and cross-database joins                          |

### **Workflow in Delphix**

1. **Connect** to source data repositories.
2. **Discover** sensitive data using pattern matching and classifiers.
3. **Define** masking rules and policies per column or data type.
4. **Apply** masking using the Delphix Masking Engine.
5. **Provision** masked, virtualized data to non-production environments.
