## Upgrade and Patch Testing Using Delphix

---

### **Objective**

Upgrade and patch testing ensures that software updates (e.g., DBMS patches, application upgrades) can be validated in isolated, production-like environments before being deployed to production.

Delphix enables **safe**, **efficient**, and **repeatable** testing of upgrades and patches through virtualization and automation.

### **Capabilities Enabled by Delphix**

| Capability                           | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Virtual Environment Provisioning** | Clone production data into isolated test environments in minutes. |
| **TimeFlow and Bookmarking**         | Create pre-upgrade snapshots for rollback and validation.         |
| **Branching**                        | Test multiple upgrade paths or patches in parallel.               |
| **Rewind and Reset**                 | Instantly reset the environment after failed upgrades.            |
| **Self-Service for QA Teams**        | Empower teams to run upgrade validations independently.           |
| **Masking Before Testing**           | Mask sensitive data before using it in test environments.         |

### **Upgrade and Patch Testing Workflow with Delphix**

| Step                            | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Snapshot Production**      | Capture a clean, consistent snapshot from production source.        |
| **2. Mask (Optional)**          | Apply data masking to anonymize sensitive data.                     |
| **3. Provision vDB**            | Create virtual environments using the snapshot for upgrade testing. |
| **4. Apply Patch/Upgrade**      | Execute the upgrade or patch scripts on the vDB.                    |
| **5. Validate**                 | Run test cases, check system integrity, and measure performance.    |
| **6. Rewind/Reset (If needed)** | Restore to pre-upgrade state to retry or run another test.          |
| **7. Promote to Production**    | Once validated, apply the changes in the real production system.    |

### **Benefits**

| Benefit                 | Description                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Fast Provisioning**   | Create test environments in minutes instead of hours or days.             |
| **Safe Testing**        | No impact on production; full rollback capability.                        |
| **Parallel Validation** | Test multiple upgrade versions simultaneously using branches.             |
| **Reduced Risk**        | Validate functionality and performance before go-live.                    |
| **Cost Efficiency**     | No need for full data copiesâ€”virtual data reduces storage and infra cost. |

### **Use Cases**

* Database engine version upgrade validation (e.g., Oracle 12c to 19c)
* Application patch regression testing
* Infrastructure OS patch testing (indirectly via application layer)
* Compliance validation after upgrade (e.g., data visibility rules)
* Compatibility testing with downstream systems after upgrade

| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Patch Tools   | Oracle OPatch, Microsoft Update |
| Testing Tools | Selenium, JMeter, Postman       |
| CI/CD         | Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD           |
