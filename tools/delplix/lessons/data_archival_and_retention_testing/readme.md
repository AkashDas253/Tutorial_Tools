## Data Archival and Retention Testing Using Delphix

---

### **Objective**

Data archival and retention testing verifies that data archiving, aging, and purging processes meet compliance, audit, and business continuity requirements. Delphix enables controlled validation of historical data access and retention policy enforcement without affecting production systems.

### **Capabilities Enabled by Delphix**

| Capability                      | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **TimeFlow Snapshots**          | Preserve historical states of data for long-term testing and validation.        |
| **On-Demand Provisioning**      | Provision old snapshots as virtual environments for archival testing.           |
| **Retention Policy Simulation** | Test how data is retained, archived, or purged based on configurable timelines. |
| **Safe Non-Production Testing** | Isolate testing of archival scripts or policies without affecting production.   |
| **Automation Support**          | Integrate archival testing into automated validation pipelines.                 |
| **Data Masking**                | Apply masking before testing archived data to ensure privacy compliance.        |

### **Data Archival and Retention Testing Workflow with Delphix**

| Step                              | Description                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Capture TimeFlow Snapshots** | Take periodic snapshots for long-term archival purposes.                  |
| **2. Apply Retention Policies**   | Configure retention durations (e.g., 3, 5, or 7 years).                   |
| **3. Provision Archived Data**    | Clone historical data for validation or audit review.                     |
| **4. Execute Retention Logic**    | Run purge or archival scripts against virtual data.                       |
| **5. Validate Outcomes**          | Ensure compliance with policies and verify successful archival.           |
| **6. Rewind/Repeat (Optional)**   | Rewind environments to test alternate policies or simulate audit queries. |

### **Benefits**

| Benefit                          | Description                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Historical Data Validation**   | Access and test old data states easily and consistently.                |
| **Policy Compliance Testing**    | Verify retention/purge rules before applying them in production.        |
| **Audit Preparation**            | Provision historical environments quickly for audit and forensic needs. |
| **Storage Efficiency**           | Avoid duplicating archived data; use space-efficient virtual copies.    |
| **Automation and Repeatability** | Integrate into governance pipelines for routine validation.             |

### **Use Cases**

* Validate compliance with data retention policies (e.g., 7-year financial data retention)
* Test purging logic for obsolete records without affecting production
* Reproduce historical data states for regulatory audits or investigations
* Verify archival performance and integrity of archived data
* Simulate legal hold and eDiscovery scenarios
