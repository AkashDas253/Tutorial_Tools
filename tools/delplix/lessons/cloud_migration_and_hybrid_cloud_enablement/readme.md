## **Cloud Migration and Hybrid Cloud Enablement** in Delphix

---

### **Objective**

Delphix facilitates **secure, fast, and efficient migration of data to the cloud** while enabling **hybrid cloud architectures** that maintain synchronized, compliant, and production-like datasets across on-premises and cloud environments.

### **Key Capabilities**

| Capability                  | Description                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Virtualization**     | Delivers virtual copies of production data to cloud targets without full replication. |
| **Cloud-Native Deployment** | Supports deployment of Delphix Engines in AWS, Azure, GCP, and Oracle Cloud.          |
| **Data Masking**            | Ensures data privacy by masking sensitive fields before moving to cloud.              |
| **Incremental Data Sync**   | Captures and sends only changes (deltas), not full datasets.                          |
| **TimeFlow for Cloud**      | Enables rewind, refresh, and branching of cloud-based data snapshots.                 |
| **API-Based Automation**    | Integrates with cloud-native tools and services for seamless operations.              |
| **Secure Transport**        | Data movement is encrypted, auditable, and compliant with privacy regulations.        |
| **Hybrid Synchronization**  | Keeps cloud and on-premise environments in sync with real-time or scheduled updates.  |

### **Deployment Options**

| Mode                  | Description                                                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lift-and-Shift**    | Move masked virtual datasets to the cloud for app rehosting.                    |
| **Dev/Test in Cloud** | Provision virtual test environments in cloud while keeping source data on-prem. |
| **Multi-Cloud**       | Use Delphix in multiple cloud platforms with unified management.                |
| **Hybrid Cloud**      | Synchronize and manage data across cloud and on-premise environments.           |

| Provider               | Supported Services                                                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AWS**                | EC2, RDS, S3 – supports AMIs and VPC integration                  |
| **Microsoft Azure**    | Azure VMs, Azure SQL, Azure Blob – available in Azure Marketplace |
| **Google Cloud**       | GCE, GCS – deploy via custom VM images                            |
| **Oracle Cloud (OCI)** | Oracle DBaaS, Compute – full support                              |

### **Workflow for Cloud Migration**

1. **Connect to On-Prem Data Sources**
2. **Capture Snapshots** or log-based deltas
3. **Apply Masking** for data privacy (optional but recommended)
4. **Transfer to Cloud** using secure transport
5. **Provision vDBs/vFiles** in cloud-based dev/test/analytics environments
6. **Manage via JetStream or APIs** with features like refresh, rewind, bookmark

---

### **Use Cases**

* Cloud-native development and testing
* Staging and QA in the cloud
* Training environments with anonymized cloud data
* Backup and recovery test scenarios in cloud
* Performance testing in scalable cloud infrastructure
* Multi-region disaster recovery validation

### **Benefits**

| Area            | Benefit                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Speed**       | Rapid provisioning of virtual data in cloud environments                 |
| **Security**    | Built-in masking ensures compliance with data protection laws            |
| **Efficiency**  | Avoids full data replication and large transfer costs                    |
| **Scalability** | Leverages cloud elasticity for high-performance testing                  |
| **Agility**     | Enables agile development workflows across hybrid or cloud-native setups |
| **Compliance**  | Secure masking ensures regulatory adherence before cloud delivery        |
