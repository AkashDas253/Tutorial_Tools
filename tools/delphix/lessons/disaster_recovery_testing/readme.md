## **Disaster Recovery (DR) Testing** in Delphix

---

### **Objective**

Enable safe, fast, and repeatable **disaster recovery testing** by leveraging **virtualized data environments** that simulate real production datasets and states — without impacting live systems or incurring high storage costs.

### **Key Capabilities**

| Capability                       | Description                                                                |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Point-in-Time Snapshots**      | Use historical data images to simulate failover or recovery scenarios.     |
| **Virtual Clones (vDBs/vFiles)** | Instantly provision full environments for DR validation.                   |
| **Bookmark & Rewind**            | Save specific states and restore environments to test rollback procedures. |
| **Self-Service Provisioning**    | Teams can run DR tests independently without waiting for infra support.    |
| **Automated Refresh**            | Keeps DR test environments in sync with production data.                   |
| **Non-Disruptive Testing**       | No effect on production systems or full database restores required.        |
| **Data Masking Integration**     | Protects sensitive data while testing recovery processes.                  |
| **API Integration**              | Automate testing via CI/CD or DR orchestration tools.                      |

### **Typical Workflow for DR Testing with Delphix**

1. **Capture snapshot** of the production database at regular intervals.
2. **Provision virtual database** (vDB) from a selected snapshot.
3. **Simulate DR scenario** (e.g., failover, restore from backup).
4. **Test application recovery** using the virtual dataset.
5. **Validate** system response, data integrity, and RTO/RPO targets.
6. **Rewind or archive** the environment after testing is complete.

---

### **Use Cases**

* Validate backup and restore strategies
* Test database failover procedures
* Validate application behavior post-disaster
* DR drills for compliance/audit
* Parallel testing of recovery across teams
* Infrastructure resiliency and rollback testing

### **Benefits**

| Area                | Benefit                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Speed**           | Quickly spin up recovery environments in minutes                        |
| **Non-Invasive**    | Does not affect live systems or require full restores                   |
| **Cost-Efficiency** | Virtualization avoids storage duplication and infra sprawl              |
| **Repeatability**   | Easily re-run DR scenarios with same or different snapshots             |
| **Realism**         | Test with masked, production-like datasets                              |
| **Automation**      | DR validation can be integrated with existing CI/CD or monitoring tools |

### **Supported Operations**

| Operation     | Use in DR Testing                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Provision** | Create DR environment instantly from a past or latest snapshot  |
| **Rewind**    | Roll back to a previous snapshot to simulate step-back recovery |
| **Bookmark**  | Mark key data states for repeatable DR test baselines           |
| **Refresh**   | Sync with latest production state before test                   |
| **Archive**   | Store specific DR snapshots for audit or long-term testing      |

### **Integration and Automation**

| Tool            | Role in DR Testing                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **CI/CD Tools** | Jenkins, GitLab – trigger recovery validation on schedule          |
| **Monitoring**  | Integrate DR test validation into incident response workflows      |
| **IaC Tools**   | Terraform, Ansible – automate provisioning of DR test environments |
| **APIs**        | Fully control DR workflows (start, stop, validate) via scripting   |

### **Challenges Solved**

| Challenge                      | How Delphix Solves It                                           |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High cost of DR environments   | Use virtual, storage-efficient datasets                         |
| Delays in DR testing cycles    | Enable rapid and repeatable test provisioning                   |
| Lack of realistic test data    | Use masked, production-like datasets without compliance risks   |
| Difficulty validating recovery | Rewind and bookmark allow simulating various recovery scenarios |

---

### **Best Practices**

* Schedule regular DR drills using **automated snapshots and provisioning**
* Use **bookmarks** for known-good configurations before simulating disaster
* Integrate **Delphix APIs** into your existing DR playbook
* Always mask sensitive data before provisioning DR environments
