## **Kubernetes GUI Tools**

---

### **Purpose**

Graphical User Interface (GUI) tools simplify the management and monitoring of Kubernetes clusters for users who prefer visual dashboards over CLI commands. They offer real-time visualization, interaction with resources, and performance insights.

---

### **Popular Kubernetes GUI Tools**

---

### **Kubernetes Dashboard**

* **Official web-based UI** maintained by Kubernetes.
* Allows:

  * View and manage deployments, pods, nodes, and namespaces
  * Create/update resources using YAML editor
  * View logs and pod metrics

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/v2.7.0/aio/deploy/recommended.yaml
kubectl proxy
```

Access via:
`http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/`

---

### **Lens**

* **Powerful desktop GUI** (Electron app)
* Features:

  * Multi-cluster management
  * Live pod logs and terminal access
  * Built-in Prometheus integration
  * Extensions support

### **Octant**

* Developed by VMware.
* Run locally to visualize cluster state.
* Features:

  * Resource navigation
  * Port forwarding, logs, and YAML viewer
  * Plugin extensibility

```bash
brew install octant
octant
```

---

### **KubeView**

* Provides a **real-time topology view** of your Kubernetes cluster.
* Useful for understanding pod/service relationships.

---

### **Portainer**

* Lightweight container GUI with Kubernetes support.
* Useful for managing both Docker and Kubernetes from a single UI.

---

### **Rancher**

* **Full-featured Kubernetes platform** for managing multiple clusters
* Offers:

  * Cluster provisioning and access control
  * Monitoring, logging, backup, and security integrations
  * RBAC and user authentication support

---

### **K8dash / Skooner**

* Modern web-based UI alternative to Kubernetes Dashboard
* Simpler and more responsive design
* Focuses on better UX with all major features

---

### **Headlamp**

* Open-source, pluggable Kubernetes UI
* React-based with dynamic plugin support
* Similar in function to Dashboard but more modern and extensible

---

### **Weave Scope**

* Real-time visualizer for cluster topology and performance
* Integrates with Weave Net, helpful in network analysis
* Allows shell access, monitoring, and process inspection

---

### **Prometheus + Grafana**

* Not a GUI for general K8s management, but essential for **monitoring dashboards**
* Grafana visualizes metrics scraped by Prometheus (e.g., CPU, memory, pods, etc.)

---

### **Argo CD UI**

* For GitOps workflows
* Visualize and sync Git-based deployments
* View app health, status, diffs, logs

---

### **Kubecost**

* GUI for **cost monitoring and optimization**
* Tracks per-namespace, per-workload, and per-label cost breakdowns

---

### **Kiali**

* Service mesh observability dashboard (for Istio)
* Features:

  * Traffic flow visualization
  * Metrics and tracing
  * Validation of Istio configuration
